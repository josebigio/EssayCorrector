/// PSPDFKit has a `UITapGestureRecognizer` to detects taps. There are several different actions called, if one succeeds further processing will be stopped.

/// First, we check if we hit a `PSPDFLinkAnnotationView` and invoke the delegates and default action if found.
///
/// Next, we check if there's text selection and discard if.
/// Then, touches are relayed to all visible `PSPDFPageView's` and `singleTapped:` is called. If one page reports that the touch has been processed; the loop is stopped.
///
/// Next, the `didTapOnPageView:atPoint:` delegate is called if the touch still hasn't been processed.
///
/// Lastly, if even the delegate returned NO, we look if `isScrollOnTapPageEndEnabled` and scroll to the next/previous page if the border is near enough; or just toggle the HUD (if that is allowed)
